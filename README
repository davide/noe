noe is a simple note-taking application built on top of ErlyWeb

INSTALLATIION

1. Install yaws, http://yaws.hyber.org
2. Install MySQL, http://mysql.org
3. Install ErlyWeb, http://erlyweb.org

4. Edit /etc/hosts (on Windows - /path/to/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts) and add:
	
	127.0.0.1	noe

5. Run migrations/main.sql to create necessary tables in you database
6. Edit src/noe_app.hrl and change database connection data and paths
7. Open console, and type:
  
	sh> make run

This will:
	- run make:all()
		- which will use the Emakefile information to compile the files
		  needed for compiling/starting noe (noe.erl for now)
	- start a Yaws server using the configuration data from ./yaws.conf
	- execute noe:start() as specified in the yaws.conf with the line:
		runmod = noe

8. You can now open up your browser and navigate to http://noe/


Additional notes for Git branch "non_root_install"
This branch implements example code of deploying an erlyweb app running on a path
different from the default root. There are many components that must work together
for such an installation to be successful:
 - erlyweb must support it (my fork does: http://github.com/davide/erlyweb/tree/non_root_install)
 - the view must get #arg as the first argument and use it to correctly prefix their
   links via erlyweb:get_app_root(A).
 - the javascript code must also determine the app_root in some way
	- this is currently broken (will welcome code to fix it!)

That's about it! Enjoy!
Davide :)
