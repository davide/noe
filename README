noe is a simple note-taking application built on top of ErlyWeb

INSTALLATIION

1. Install yaws, http://yaws.hyber.org
2. Install MySQL, http://mysql.org
3. Install ErlyWeb, http://erlyweb.org

4. Edit /etc/hosts (on Windows - /path/to/windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts) and add:
	
	127.0.0.1	noe

5. Run migrations/main.sql to create necessary tables in you database
6. Edit src/noe_app.hrl and change database connection data and paths
7. Open console, and type:
  
	sh> make run

This will:
	- run make:all()
		- which will use the Emakefile information to compile the files
		  needed for compiling/starting noe (noe.erl for now)
	- start a Yaws server using the configuration data from ./yaws.conf
	- execute noe:start() as specified in the yaws.conf with the line:
		runmod = noe

8. You can now open up your browser and navigate to http://noe/


Additional notes for Git branch "packaged"
This branch includes the changes made in branch "non_root_install" and repacks
the project using erlang packages (http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/packages.html).
For now this code will only work with code from this erlyweb branch:
http://github.com/davide/erlyweb/tree/erlyweb-packaged
The main advantage theses changes bring is that you can now host several erlyweb
webapps independently in the same yaws server running (without code clashes).

That's about it! Enjoy!
Davide :)
